# job-mirror-unified

A job to mirror hg repos via github action.

* https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-unified --> https://github.com/thunderbird/l10n-comm-unified

The action code is designed with Mercurial repositories such as Mozilla's
[mozilla-unified](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-unified) and
[comm-unified](https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-unified) in mind as they publish the necessary
bookmarks.

The only supported use of the action code in this repository is the temporary
mirroring of comm-unified to Github.

# Description

This project sets up a Github action under .github/actions/mirror-hgmo. The
source code is under actions/mirror-hgmo, and was originally forked from
[mirror-hg-repo](https://github.com/mozillazg/mirror-hg-repo).

The action is triggered in the main workflow (.github/workflows/main.yml) either
manually or by cron scheduling.

Like the original action, Mark Nauwelaerts' fork of git-remote-hg is used for
the actual mirroring. It is simply included in this repository from
https://github.com/mnauw/git-remote-hg rather than utilizing the copy used
by upstream.

Unlike the original, there is no support for using a Github Personal Token
for push access to the Github repository. It is expected that an SSH Deploy
Key is used, and this project in fact uses `shimataro/ssh-key-action` to
handle setting the key up.

This project also caches the working copy that it creates using `actions/cache`.
