/**
 * MboxMsgOutputStream writes a single message out to an underlying mbox
 * stream.
 * It's a nsISafeOutputStream so callers need to "commit" the written data
 * by calling nsISafeOutputStream::Finish() when done.
 * Just calling Close(), or letting the stream go out of scope will
 * cause a rollback, and the underlying mbox file will be truncated back
 * to the size it was.
 *
 * Aims:
 * - Byte exact. What you write is exactly what should come back out when
 *   read.
 *   NOTE: There is one exception. Messages with an unterminated
 *   final line will have an EOL added. Without this, there's no way to
 *   ensure the proper message separation required for a well-formed mbox.
 * - Handles malformed messages - everything is just stored verbatim.
 * - Uses reversible "From " escaping, as per mboxrd. "From " lines are
 *   prefixed with '>'. If already prefixed, another '>' is added.
 *   e.g. "From Bob Smith" => ">From Bob Smith".
 *        ">>>>From here..." => ">>>>>From here..."
 * - Avoid intermediate copies of data. The only time buffering is required is
 *   where "From " parts are split across Write() calls.
 * - Handle processing lines of any length, without extra memory usage.
 * - Leaves output buffering up to the target mbox stream.
 * - Provide a reasonable rollback mechanism (as nsISafeOutputStream).
