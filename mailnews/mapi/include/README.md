The contents of this directory are from the MAPI Stub Library, formerly
Outlook MAPI Headers.

The files were downloaded from https://github.com/microsoft/MAPIStubLibrary
at revision a888542d2e2630bf0da3b3855d198773b61c700e.

Changes:

- The files have been renamed to lower-cased filenames for cross-compiling
compatibility.
- MAPI.h was intentionally removed.
- MAPIx.h has had its #include lines changed to use double quotes rather than
  angled brackets
