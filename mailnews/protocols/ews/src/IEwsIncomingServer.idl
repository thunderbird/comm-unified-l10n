 * IEwsIncomingServer is intended as a workaround for limitations in the folder
 * lookup service.
 *
 * EWS folders require an EWS client object in order to fetch new messages. The
 * folder itself, however, does not have access to all of the details needed to
 * create such a client. This information is part of the incoming server.
 *
 * Due to depending on the folder lookup service to create new folders, it is
 * not possible to give the folder a direct handle to its associated server, so
 * we are forced to go through XPCOM.
