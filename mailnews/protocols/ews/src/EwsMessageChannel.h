/**
 * A channel for streaming an EWS message out of the relevant message store.
 *
 * The message URI is expected to use the form:
 * x-moz-ews://{user}@{server}/{Path/To/Folder}/{MessageKey}
 *
 * Note that no specific encoding is applied to the folder path (besides the
 * standard URL path encoding).
 *
 * Translating this URI into a message header (which we can use to stream the
 * message's content from the message store) is done through calling
 * `EwsService::MessageURIToMsgHdr`.
 *
 * Design considerations on the form of "x-moz-ews" URIs: it includes the
 * message key in the path to follow RESTful semantics. The message is the
 * resource the URI is pointing to, "located" to the path preceding its key
 * (i.e. the path to the folder). Some alternatives that were considered are:
 *  * Setting the key as a query parameter, however we seem to use query
 *    parameters to control how the message is fetched and/or rendered/streamed,
 *    not which message the operation is about, so it would be inconsistent with
 *    the rest of the code.
 *  * Following the lead of `[protocol]-message` URIs, with the message key
 *    located in the "ref" part of the URI. However, this does not work well for
 *    displaying messages, as the DocShell does not take this part of the URI
 *    into account to decide whether it matches with a document that's already
 *    currently rendered (so it doesn't need to render it again); this would
 *    lead to every message in a folder being considered the same document.
