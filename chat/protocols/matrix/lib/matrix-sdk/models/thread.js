     * If all replies in this thread are redacted, this is set to the root
     * event. I'm not clear what the meaning of this is, since usually after the
     * initial events have been fetched, lastEvent should be undefined.
     * In fact, the whole usage inside onRedaction looks suspect - it may be
     * that we were thinking lastEvent always refers to the actual last event,

     *
     * The usage of lastEvent inside {@link onEcho} looks suspicious, since I'd

     * echo a duplicate event, and we probably want that behaviour even after
