Soft line breaks will be ignored when displayed by the receiving client. When flowed output is enabled, add-ons should not create plain text messages with manually inserted hard or soft line breaks to achieve a certain text width, as that will most probably interfere with the default line break handling and generate ridged text. When flowed output is disabled, add-ons could add hard line breaks to have control over the final message, but any line longer than the maximum line length will still receive additional hard line breaks. See $(ref:messengerSettings.messageLineLengthLimit)."
