# This file contains Thunderbird-specific telemetry Scalar definitions, which
# are added on top of the Firefox ones (in /toolkit/components/telemetry).
# To avoid name clashes, all the TB scalars will be under a "tb" section.
# They are submitted with the "main" pings and can be inspected in about:telemetry.

# The following section is for probes testing the Telemetry system.
# Under normal operation, these won't be invoked.
